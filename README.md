Protein Study Report Overview

I have developed a comprehensive 5-page Power BI report based on surveyed data related to protein consumption. Below is a summary of each page within the report:

Quota Analysis:
This page presents a comparison between the target sample size and the actual number of interviews conducted. The data is segmented by various demographic breakups, providing insights into the representativeness of the achieved sample relative to the intended targets.

Demographics:
This page provides detailed demographic breakdowns, including center, zone, gender, and age group distributions. Additionally, income levels are analyzed across these demographic segments.

Protein Penetration:
This section focuses on protein powder awareness among the surveyed population. It provides insights into how well-known protein supplements are across different demographic segments, helping to identify potential gaps in market awareness.

Protein Consumption:
Here, the report delves into actual protein consumption habits. It details the quantity of protein supplements consumed per serving, the frequency of consumption, and the types of protein products used, such as protein bars.

Protein Spending:
The final page analyzes spending patterns on protein products. It includes data on purchase frequency, the amount spent on protein powders, and the preferred brands among consumers. This section provides a comprehensive view of consumer behavior in the protein supplement market.
